# UK GHG Emissions Prediction

Linear regression analysis and short-term prediction of UK greenhouse gas emissions using Python.

Objective
- Analyse historical UK greenhouse gas emissions data
- Identify long-term trends
- Produce short-term forecasts using a simple regression model

Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas
- Linear regression using scikit-learn
- Visualisation using matplotlib

Results
The analysis shows a clear long-term decline in emissions.  
The model predicts continued reductions over the next five years, illustrated in the final plot.

Repository Structure
- `uk_ghg_emissions_prediction.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook  
- `data/` – Raw emissions dataset  

Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
